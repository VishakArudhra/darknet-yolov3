# darknet-yolov3

This repository is just a graveyard equivalent of a failed attempt at training the yolov3 model to predict bounding boxes around fields in invoices. 
Anyways, the images will not be included but the texts and and other meta files will be just to deliver an idea of what I tried to work on. 
The process in its own right was successful but there is an extricable error hidden somewhere in the model or training configuration. 
Due that error, the iterations constantly showed meagre IoUs and stagnant losses. 
So if you're reading this and think you know the fix right fix, do ping me!
